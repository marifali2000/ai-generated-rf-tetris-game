## What Is This?

A modern Tetris clone that runs directly in your browser with zero dependencies — pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools, no npm install. Just open and play.

### Features

- **Classic Tetris gameplay** — 10×20 grid, 7 standard tetrominoes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- **Super Rotation System (SRS)** with wall kicks for competitive-quality rotation
- **7-bag randomizer** for fair piece distribution
- **Ghost piece** showing where the piece will land
- **Hold piece** — swap the current piece once per drop
- **Next piece preview** — see the next 3 coming pieces
- **DAS/ARR** (Delayed Auto Shift / Auto Repeat Rate) for competitive movement speed
- **T-spin detection** with bonus scoring
- **Back-to-back bonus** for consecutive difficult clears
- **Combo system** with escalating rewards
- **Perfect clear detection** with bonus scoring
- **Progressive difficulty** — gravity increases every 10 lines
- **9 visual themes** — Glass, Concrete, Crystal, Metal, Ice, Wood, Plastic, Gold, Silver

### Sound Design

All sounds are generated procedurally using the **Web Audio API** — no audio files needed:

- **9 selectable sound themes**: Glass Shatter, Concrete Break, Crystal Chime, Metal Clang, Ice Crack, Wood Knock, Plastic Pop, Gold Ring, Silver Chime
- Per-row highlight and cell pop sounds synced to line clear animations
- Dramatic line clear effects with shattering/breaking sounds
- Impact thuds on hard drop, crystalline clicks on rotation
- Escalating drama for Tetris (4-line) clears
- Combo hit, T-spin, back-to-back, and perfect clear audio cues
- Danger zone heartbeat pulse when the stack gets high
- Adjustable volume and animation speed controls

### Visual Effects

- **Multi-phase line clear**: row highlight → cell shrink → particle burst → shockwave
- **Falling cell animation** with gravity physics and landing glow
- **Per-theme cell rendering** — each of the 9 themes has a distinct visual style for both board cells and preview panels
- Screen shake on hard drops and line clears
- Piece trail motion blur
- Lock bounce with squash-and-stretch
- Lock pulse glow on placed pieces
- Floating combo text and score popups
- Danger zone pulsing when the stack gets high
- Game over collapse cascade with rotation and gravity
- Level-up celebration with golden particles
- Animated stars background with speed boost on clears
- Board edge glow and vignette

### Mobile Support

- Fully responsive layout that adapts to any screen size
- Touch gesture controls: swipe left/right to move, swipe down to hard drop, tap to rotate, two-finger tap to hold
- Slide-out hamburger menu with all settings
- Mobile-optimized hold/next panels and stats bar
- Orientation lock warning on landscape
- Tutorial overlay for first-time mobile users

### Demo Mode

Hit the **DEMO** button (or press `D`) to watch the AI autoplay — it evaluates all possible placements and picks the best move using a weighted heuristic covering height, holes, bumpiness, and line clears.

## Architecture & Design Practices

### SOLID Principles

This project follows SOLID principles adapted for a vanilla JavaScript ES module architecture:

- **Single Responsibility** — Each module has one clear purpose: `Board` manages the grid and collision, `Piece` defines shapes and rotation, `Renderer` handles canvas drawing, `SoundEngine` manages audio, `Scoring` tracks points and levels, `InputHandler` processes keyboard and touch, `EffectsEngine` runs visual animations, `AutoPlayer` drives AI demo mode.
- **Open/Closed** — New sound themes are added by creating a new theme module in `js/sounds/` and registering it in the `THEME_MAP` — no modification to the `SoundEngine` dispatcher. New visual themes follow the same pattern via dispatch tables in `cell-themes.js`.
- **Liskov Substitution** — All 9 sound theme modules expose the same interface (spawn, rotate, lock, hardDrop, lineClear, etc.). Any theme can be swapped at runtime without affecting the sound engine.
- **Interface Segregation** — The `EffectsEngine` exposes granular methods (`drawVanishingRows`, `drawFallingCells`, `drawShockwaves`, etc.) so the `Renderer` only calls what it needs per frame.
- **Dependency Inversion** — High-level modules (`Game`) depend on abstractions. Sound callbacks are injected into the renderer via `setSoundCallbacks()`. The renderer doesn't know about the sound engine directly.

### Design Patterns Used

| Pattern | Where | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Strategy** | `js/sounds/*.js` | 9 interchangeable sound theme modules behind a common interface |
| **Dispatch Table** | `js/rendering/cell-themes.js` | Theme-keyed maps (`MINI_CELL_DRAWERS`, `PREVIEW_CELL_DRAWERS`) replace switch statements |
| **Observer** | `js/input.js` | Event callback registration via `on(action, callback)` |
| **Facade** | `js/sound.js` | Thin dispatcher that delegates to the active theme module |
| **Composition** | `js/renderer.js` → `js/rendering/effects.js` | Renderer composes an `EffectsEngine` for all animation state and drawing |
| **Module Pattern** | All files | ES modules with explicit `export` for encapsulation |

### Coding Standards

- **No file exceeds 1,000 lines** — largest is `game.js` at 863 lines
- **No function exceeds 50 lines** — complex methods are split into focused helpers (e.g., `Game` constructor uses 7 `#init*()` methods, `drawFrame` delegates to 6 private helper methods)
- **ES2020+ features** — private class fields (`#field`), optional chaining (`?.`), nullish coalescing, `Object.freeze()`, arrow functions, template literals
- **`const`/`let` only** — no `var` anywhere
- **Class syntax** for all game entities (`Board`, `Piece`, `Renderer`, `SoundEngine`, `EffectsEngine`, `InputHandler`, `Scoring`, `AutoPlayer`, `Particle`)
- **`requestAnimationFrame`** for the game loop — no `setInterval`
- **Feature detection** for Web Audio API with graceful silent fallback
- **Zero dependencies** — no npm, no CDN, no build step
- **No transpilation needed** — runs natively in all modern browsers (ES2020+)

## How It Was Built

This entire game was built using **GitHub Copilot** with custom skills and instructions:

1. **Scaffolded** the project structure with a prompt file that defined the full Tetris specification
2. **Generated** all game logic (board, pieces, SRS rotation, collision, scoring) through AI-assisted coding
3. **Designed** procedural sound effects using a dedicated sound design skill with Web Audio API recipes
4. **Created** dramatic animations using an eye-catching animations skill with particle systems and multi-phase effects
5. **Polished** the UI/UX with a visual enhancement skill covering colors, layout, and responsive design
6. **Added** mobile touch controls and responsive CSS for phone/tablet play
7. **Refactored** to enforce coding guidelines — max 1,000 lines/file, max 50 lines/function, SOLID principles throughout
8. **Extended** with 9 visual + sound themes using Strategy pattern and dispatch tables
